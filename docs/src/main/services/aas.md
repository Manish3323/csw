# Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS)

THe Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS) is a suite of libraries (i.e. adapters) provided by CSW to help build an
ecosystem of client & server side applications that enforce the authentication and authorization policies for TMT.

The backbone of AAS is the [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) product. It is where all client and server
applications need to be registered and configured. Keycloak comes bundled with `csw-services.sh` so you
don't have to download & install it manually. It is installed the first time you run `csw-services.sh`.

In the current authentication and authorization model for TMT, users will use browser-based graphical user
interfaces to perform authentication through AAS. Sequencers, Assemblies and HCDs execute within the
authenticated environment, but do not concern themselves directly with authorization and authentication.
