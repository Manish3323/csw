Framework
=========

The framework provides templates for the kind of software components defined by TMT as well as service access interfaces.

It provides an Akka-actor based abstraction for features like concurrency, asynchronous remote messaging, handling
lifecycle of components, akka supervision for fault-tolerance and integration with rich library ecosystem.
