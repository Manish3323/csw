Command Service
===============

Command Service helps with command based communication between components. It provides ways to send commands to other
components and receive response for validations and completion. It also provides mechanisms to manage command execution
for received commands through a 'CommandResponseManager' available via framework.

If you want to get started with command service, 
refer the [examples](https://tmtsoftware.github.io/csw-prod/command.html) for command based communication and,
refer the [examples](https://tmtsoftware.github.io/csw-prod/framework/managing-command-state.html) for managing commands received.

You can refer to Scala documentation [here](https://tmtsoftware.github.io/csw-prod/api/scala/csw/services/command/index.html).

You can refer to Java documentation [here](https://tmtsoftware.github.io/csw-prod/api/java/?/index.html).
